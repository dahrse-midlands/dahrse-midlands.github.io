      <description>&lt;p&gt;Post-Event Update:
The DAHRSE-Midlands workshop originally planned as an in-person event was delivered in a scaled-down online format on 5th November 2025. This adjustment allowed us to maintain the workshop’s core objectives while making participation more accessible for our community. Despite the change in format, the event successfully fostered collaboration and knowledge exchange among attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are &lt;a href=&#34;https://tinyurl.com/Call-for-Short-Talks&#34;&gt;invited to submit a short talk for Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineers in the Midlands 2025&lt;/a&gt; (DAHRSE-Midlands 2025)—a regional event that brings together research software engineers and related professionals, such as digital Research Technical Professionals, working in the digital humanities and arts across the UK Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday 5th November 2025 sees the first edition of the DAHRSE Midlands meeting.
This year’s event is being hosted by the Dr Godwin Yeboah
at the University of Warwick’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://warwick.ac.uk/services/conferences/spaces/scarman/&#34;&gt;Scarman building&lt;/a&gt;, and is sponsored by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes/fellowship-programme&#34;&gt;SSI (the Software Sustainability Institute)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s inaugural meeting is a chance to build community, meet new and old friends, and learn more about the incredible
breadth of skills DAHRSEs in the Midlands possess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;registration&#34;&gt;Registration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t want finances to be a barrier to any attendees, and so &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes/fellowship-programme&#34;&gt;the Software Sustainability Institute&lt;/a&gt; has generously offered support with any travel expenses. People are able to enquire if they would like to take advantage of this help.&lt;/p&gt;

It was easy to get a taxi or bus from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/COV/details.html&#34;&gt;Coventry Train Station&lt;/a&gt; so you may have had to book a taxi in advance if you prefer not to &lt;a href=&#34;https://maps.app.goo.gl/wHnVyjMho5Y7qAms8&#34;&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;bus&#34;&gt;Bus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were travelling by train, there are regular buses from the Coventry rail station, Coventry city centre as well as Leamington Spa. You could have easily gotten taxis from these locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 11 and 12 bus routes may be ideal from Coventry. Both buses call at the Rail Station Bridge stop on Warwick Road; this stop is few minutes walk from Coventry station as shown on &lt;a href=&#34;https://maps.app.goo.gl/NzFK3rVHBS17jQ7f9&#34;&gt;Google maps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;car&#34;&gt;Car&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were travelling by car, the postcode for Scarman building is CV4 7SH and it is located within the University of Warwick campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scarman conference centre is located on central campus, which is signposted off Gibbet Hill Road.

      <description>In recent years, the integration of digital technologies into the arts and humanities has opened new avenues for research and innovation. One of the key drivers of this transformation is the emergence of Digital Arts and Humanities Research Software Engineers (DAHRSEs). These professionals possess a unique blend of technical expertise and a deep understanding of the arts and humanities, making them invaluable assets in the research landscape.
The Role of DAHRSE in the Midlands The Midlands region of England, known for its rich cultural heritage and vibrant academic community, is an ideal setting for the growth of DAHRSE.</description>
